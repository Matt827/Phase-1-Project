# Phase-1-Project

## User Story
Welcome to Brewski Time! When you visit our website you'll be able to find the perfect beer that matches your individual preference!

## MVP
To enter the page, you must first check a box to confirm that you are 21 or older. The site will be blurred behind the promt until the box is checked. Once on the site, from an intereactive carousel of beer images at the bottom of the page, you can see details about the beer by clicking on whichever beer image your heart desires. Once you click on a beer you'll be able to see the name, tagline, picture and description about the beer's flavor profile displayed in the center of the page. When you mouse over an image it highlights.

## Stretch Goals
1. Dropdown menu that filters the beers by the first letter of the beer.
2. Rating button. 
3. Redirect to social media pages
4. Add food pairngs button that toggles the food pairings suggest with the beer
5. Add show instructions button that toggles a table of the ingredients for the beer
